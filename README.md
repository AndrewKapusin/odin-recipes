# odin-recipes
This is my first official project for The Odin Project in pursuit of my front-end developer skills.

So far, I have learned the basic structure and components of an HTML page.

Such as:
    * boilerplate
    * headings
    * paragraphs
    * attributes
    * bold, italics, hierarchical elements
    * links
    * images (png, jpg, svg, gif)

This project will be the html template for a recipe website. I will further develop this webpage in css and javascript in future assignments.
